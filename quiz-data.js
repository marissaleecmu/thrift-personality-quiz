/* =============================================================
   Secondhand Shopper Personality Quiz — data & scoring
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   10 result "types", each an ALIAS for a real secondhand platform.
   Scoring uses NORMALIZATION: a user's raw points for each type are
   divided by the maximum points that type could earn. The winner is
   the highest ratio, so every result is equally achievable even
   though the raw point opportunities differ slightly per type.
